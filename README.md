# Bunny Hop

[Play Bunny Hop!](https://olga-bessonova.github.io/BunnyHop/)

# Background

A side-scrolling game where the main character bunny needs to get from start to finish. Along the way the bunny defeats enemies by jumping on top of them. The bunny has one life. The bunny loses life if an enemy bites or the bunny fall through the gap on a map. If the bunny falls through the pitfall, the game restarts. If an enemy kills the bunny, a "GAME OVER" message appears and the game stops.

There is a scoring system. The game ends successfully if the map ends and the bunny reaches the finish.
